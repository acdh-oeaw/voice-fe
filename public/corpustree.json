The\n                        recordings were carried out between July 2001 and November\n                        2007, usually using portable mini-disc recorders with\n                        external microphones. Most of the audio-recordings are\n                        supplemented by detailed field notes including information\n                        about the nature of the speech event and the interaction\n                        taking place as well as about the participants engaging in\n                        these ELF interactions.

Nevertheless,\n                    linguistic descriptions before the mid-2000s focused almost\n                    entirely on English as spoken and written by its native speakers.\n                    Starting in 2005, the VOICE project sought to redress the\n                    balance by compiling the first general corpus capturing\n                    spoken ELF interactions as they happen naturally in various\n                    contexts. VOICE was designed and compiled to make possible\n                    linguistic descriptions of this most common contemporary use\n                    of English by providing a corpus of spoken ELF interactions\n                    which has been freely accessible to linguistic researchers\n                    all over the world since 2009. The corpus is stored in a\n                    TEI-based XML format and rendered accessible online through\n                    an open-access user interface at  <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/voice3.acdh.oeaw.ac.at\">https:\/\/voice3.acdh.oeaw.ac.at<\/a>.\n                    HTML and TXT versions of the corpus are provided in the VOICE 3.0 XML download package.\n                    The current versions VOICE 3.0 Online and VOICE 3.0 XML were \n                    created between April 2020 and September 2021 in the VOICE CLARIAH\n                    project (see  <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/voice.acdh.oeaw.ac.at\">https:\/\/voice.acdh.oeaw.ac.at<\/a>). \n                    The previously separate part-of-speech (POS) tagged and lemmatized version of\n                    VOICE XML and VOICE Online has been fully incorporated into VOICE 3.0 \n                    XML and VOICE 3.0 Online.\n                <\/p><p>\n                    The unit chosen for sampling data for inclusion in VOICE is\n                    that of the speech event.

The speech\n                    events were selected for inclusion in the corpus on the basis\n                    of a set of seven external, i.e. non-linguistic, criteria,\n                    which therefore define the target population.
